# My Project

By following these steps, you should have successfully set up Minikube with Docker, installed kubectl, and optionally configured Jenkins for CI/CD automation. This setup will allow you to deploy microservices applications on Kubernetes locally with minimal downtime using strategies like blue-green deployment.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
## Tools Required
1. **VM (Virtual Machine)** - You need to create a Virtual Machine on your system to install and run Minikube.
2. **Minikube** - Tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally.
3. **Docker** - A containerization tool needed for Minikube's setup.
4. **kubectl** - Command line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
5. **Jenkins** - For automating deployment processes (optional, for CI/CD).
6. **Linux (Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora)** - Minikube works best on Linux operating systems.

---
## Prerequisites

1. **Create a VM:**
    - Install a Virtual Machine platform like VirtualBox, VMware, or KVM.
    - Set up a Linux distribution (Red Hat 9.2 is suggested).

2. **Install Docker:**
    - Follow the installation guide for Docker based on your operating system:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install docker -y
        sudo systemctl start docker
        sudo systemctl enable docker
        ```
    - Make sure the Docker daemon is running and that your user is added to the Docker group:
        ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        newgrp docker
        ```

3. **Install Minikube:**
    - Download and install Minikube:
        ```bash
        curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
        sudo mv minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minikube
        ```

4. **Install kubectl:**
    - Install kubectl using `dnf` or download the binary manually:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install kubectl -y
        ```

---

## Installation Steps

1. **Install Minikube:**
   - Run the following command to start Minikube with the default driver (Docker in this case):
     ```bash
     minikube start --driver=docker
     ```

2. **Verify Minikube Setup:**
   - Check if Minikube is running:
     ```bash
     minikube status
     ```

3. **Setting up Jenkins (Optional for CI/CD):**
    - Pull the latest Jenkins Docker image:
      ```bash
      sudo docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
      ```
    - Run Jenkins in a Docker container:
      ```bash
      sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
      ```
    - Retrieve the Jenkins initial admin password:
      ```bash
      sudo docker exec -it jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
      ```

4. **Access Jenkins:**
    - Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and use the password retrieved above to unlock Jenkins.

5. **Set up Kubernetes with Minikube:**
   - Use kubectl to interact with the Kubernetes cluster created by Minikube:
     ```bash
     kubectl cluster-info
     ```

---

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

1. **Install Jenkins Plugins:**
   - From the Jenkins dashboard, go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**, and install necessary plugins such as:
     - Kubernetes Plugin
     - CloudBees Folder Plugin
     - Docker Pipeline Plugin
     - Git Plugin

2. **Configure CI/CD Pipeline
   - Set up your Jenkins pipeline for automating deployments to Kubernetes clusters using Jenkins and Docker.


### Webhooks

To trigger Jenkins pipeline builds automatically on code changes, set up a webhook in your GitHub repository with the following URL:

http://your-jenkins-server/github-webhook/


### Docker Setup

#### Docker Commands

To build and run your Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker Image:
  
   docker build -t my-django-app .


2. Run a Container using the Built Image:

  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-django-app

  Replace 8000:8000 with the appropriate port mapping if your Django application uses a different port.

3. View Running Containers:
   docker ps


4. Push the Docker Image to a Registry (e.g., Docker Hub):

docker push username/my-django-app


Replace username with your Docker Hub username and my-django-app with the name you want to give to your Docker image.
